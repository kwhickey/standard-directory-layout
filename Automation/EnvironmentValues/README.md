The root folder under which all variables (aka properties, settings, configuration values, parameters, etc.) will be declared, to include
- *default* values used for an *Aspect* and *Component* in *all* environments
- *environment-specific* values for an *Aspect* and *Component*

**If anything cannot be "hard-coded" and be safe (i.e. it *does* infact vary in its value from time-to-time or deployment-to-deployment), then it <u>should</u> be declared in a file somewhere under here.**
