Design artifacts that are desired to be version controlled and kept in-sync with code (at the same source control revision) so that the designs show an accurate portrayal of the code within a revision.

This should not be static exports of design documentation (PDFs, Microsoft Office documents). But rather be a live project in which design documents are constantly updated.
- UML projects
- Possibly Visio documentation, if this is the chosen tool
- ER diagramming tool projects

The size of these projects should be considered so that the design docs don't weigh down the repository. If the design "source" gets over 100MB or so, consideration should be given to moving this folder out to a separate repository.
